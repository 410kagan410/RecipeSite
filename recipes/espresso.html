        <li><p><b>Grinding the coffee:</b> Use espresso roast coffee, about 9 grams for a single espresso shot and<br>
             18 grams for a double shot. Grind the coffee until it’s very fine ground. Different roasts and brands 
             <br>of beans will require a different grind for your machine. You may need to do a few test runs to get it dialed in just right.</p></li>
             <li><p><b>Pack and tamp the coffee grounds:</b> Add the coffee grounds to the espresso basket (portafilter) until it’s slightly heaping over the top.<br>
                Use the tamper to press the grounds evenly into the portafilter, pressing very firmly until it is fully compressed. Place the portafilter<br>
                on a folded towel before tamping, or the best tool is a

                 for tamping and discarding used grounds.<br>
                It’s important for the coffee grounds to be as even and straight as possible to get the best espresso shot.</p>
             </li>
             <li><p><b>Pull the shot:</b> Place the portafilter in the espresso machine and press the button to pull the shot.<br>
                Most home espresso machines have an automatic option for this. A well-pulled espresso shot will last around 25 to 30 seconds<br>
                and have deep espresso flavor with a nice foamy crema.</p></li>
            <li><p><b>Consider any adjustments:</b> It takes a while to dial in the fineness of the coffee grind and amount of coffee to use:<br>
                practice makes perfect! If the shot is watery, use slightly more coffee grounds or a finer grind on the coffee.<br>
                If a shot takes longer than 30 seconds, reduce the amount of coffee grounds or use a coarser grind on the coffee.</p></li>
