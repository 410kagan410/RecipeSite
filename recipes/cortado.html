        <!-- recipe from "https://methodicalcoffee.com/blogs/coffee-culture/what-is-a-cortado-and-how-do-you-make-one"-->
        <li><b>Steam the Milk:</b><br>
        Pour four ounces of milk into your steaming pitcher (you’ll only pour about two ounces into your cortado glass).<br>
        For a cortado, you won’t need to create foam so much as just steaming the milk thoroughly.</li>
        <li><b>Pour and Enjoy:</b><br>
            Carefully pour the steamed milk into the espresso, aiming for an equal ratio of espresso to milk.<br>
            The result should be a balanced blend of strong coffee and creamy milk. Then, drink up!<br>
            Cortados are meant to be enjoyed immediately to preserve the balance of flavors.
